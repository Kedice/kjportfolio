            <h2>Production Notes</h2>
         <p> Warner Bros.' Looney Tunes, led by the creative impetus of filmmaker IVAN REITMAN, blast into the future in their first feature film, "Space Jam," an animated/live-action razzle-dazzle tour de force pairing pop icon and sports megastar MICHAEL JORDAN and classic wisecracking animated hero BUGS BUNNY.

As audiences visually zoom between Earth and outer space, between basketball court, baseball field and Looney Tunes Land, from live action with some of the NBA's biggest stars to startlingly rich two- and three-dimensional animation, they'll get a laugh-loaded glimpse of the future as it's never looked before -- in the company of basketball's most watchable genius and the hip-hoppin'-est hoopster a rabbit ever hoped to become.

        <p>Production PhotoIvan Reitman produces and JOE PYTKA directs "Space Jam," a fast-breaking comic fantasy. Joe Medjuck and Daniel Goldberg also produce with Reitman, from a script by Steve Rudknick and Leo Benvenuiti and Timonthy Harris & Herschel Weingrod. David Falk and Ken Ross executive produce. Gordon Webb, Sheldon Kahn and Curtis Polk co-produce. </p>
